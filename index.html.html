       <h4> 1. Install Airmirror App:</h4><br><div>

       <p>The first app on our list is AirMirror. As the name itself suggest, AirMirror fulfills the goal to control one Android phone with another. Do note that to get complete access to the application you will need AirDroid installed on the target device (someone’s device) and log in with the same account details. With over eleven thousand reviews and a 4.2 rating, the AirMirror is downloaded over a million times from Google Play Store. The crowd-pulling feature here is the One-way Audio recording. Using this feature you will be able to hear all the surrounding sounds from your remote device.<br> <br>You can use the application without signing up. Users can get connected quickly by using a 9-digit code. You can send the target device screen sharing request with one tap and you will be able to see the device screen in real-time. Unlike many other applications of this kind, AirMirror provides a voice communication feature by which you can talk and control at the same time. Of course, there is an option to text chat if you feel like not talking on a voice chat.</p><br>

       <p>RemoDroid is also one of the finest applications to control someone’s Android device remotely. Although the interface of the application is boring and old, the implementation and usage is on the top. With over seven thousand reviews and a 3.5-star rating, the app is downloaded more than a million times from the Play Store. You can control diverse devices including Android phones, tablets, Windows PCs, and Mac devices. <br><br>Despite the description of the application reads that the app is in its beta state and could be buggy at times, we did not find any such issues during our testing. It is worth noting that to remote control your screen you will need root permission.</p>

        <p>With over 3.6-star ratings and twelve thousand plus reviews, Inkwire is downloaded over five million times from Google Play Store. Coming from the house of ClockWorkMod, the application itself is very popular for the features it houses. For those who aren’t aware, ClockWorkMod is otherwordly also known as CWM. The CWM has been an integral part of Android custom development during its initial stages. They had developed some amazing custom recovery and root files for many Android devices which now is taken over by TWRP (TeamWin Recovery Project). Well, the custom ROM and recovery is a story for another day. Now, let us come back to Inkwire.
        <br>
        <br>
        Despite not having any groundbreaking features and elements, the Inkwire has become a go-to for various users for its overall stability. Features here include the ability to request control within a few taps, the ability to voice chat and draw on their screen to guide them. The interface of the application is well-polished and we did not find any issues throughout our testing.</p>

      <p>Yes, we have saved the best for the last. ApowerMirror, as the name itself suggests is one of the most powerful and best apps to control someone’s Android device remotely. The features here are endless. You can remotely control others or your Android device from a PC or a Mac. Not just that, you can fully control devices using the mouse and keyboard. How cool is that? The app also allows you to cast and share your Android screen to the PC using both USB and WiFi. You can also record your target phone’s screen from your device directly using the application. With about four-star ratings and forty-three thousand reviews, ApowerMirror is downloaded over five million times.</p>

    <p>With that, the list of our best apps to control someone’s Android device remotely comes to an end. We would recommend trying and test out each and every app on the list as all of them have their own strengths and flaws. If you do not have a lot of time to test the apps, I would recommend you to go with either TeamViewer or Apowermirror. With that said, it is time for me to bid you adieu.
